# GetYoutubeSubscriptions
Growing up with the creation and explosion of youtube, it naturally became a major part of my daily routine. It was around this time that youtube was having issues with it’s subscription notifications. Many times I would miss multiple videos from a youtuber I enjoyed because it would never appear in my feed. To combat this, I created ReliableSubBox, a windows forms application written in C#. 

With it, you can type in the channel of your choice, hit save, and it will act as a web scraper to get the user’s last three video links as well as the thumbnails for each video. As a result, every time you open the app, it checks the user’s page and presents their last three video thumbnails, which you can click to take you directly to the video. Simple and efficient! All of your favorite channels in one place! It is also useful if for some reason you do not have a google account but still want to keep up with specific content creators. 

This application was my first real experimentation with an application that could interact with the internet and save data from it. While it never received much actual use from me, it was a joy to build and helped me to expand my programming capabilities.
